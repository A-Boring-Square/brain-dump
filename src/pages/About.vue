      We are a <abbr title="A group of identities, selves, or members who share a single body and mind">plural system</abbr> known as <strong>The Calming Breeze</strong>, also recognized online as <strong>A-Boring-Square</strong>. This site is a shared space for our thoughts, projects, and creative expression.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our system consists of multiple facets working together. At the core are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sebastian</strong> – The most often fronter and logical core of the system. Focused on structured thinking, technical execution, and analytical problem-solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Sarah</strong> – Emotionally driven and deeply intuitive, Sarah complements Sebastian by processing and guiding the emotional, creative, and interpersonal aspects of our system's experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Though we are closely intertwined, each of us brings a unique perspective to our work, allowing us to function both cohesively and dynamically.
    </p>
