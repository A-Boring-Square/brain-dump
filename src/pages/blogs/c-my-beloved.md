C, My Beloved
=============

I love C because it is close to the hardware. It does not hide complexity it exposes it, lets you touch it, and expects you to know what you’re doing. There is a beauty in that rawness. It will not nag you about best practices or force you into patterns you don’t need. Instead, it gives you the tools and says: “Figure it out.” With C, the control is absolute. Want to write past the bounds of an array? It will let you. Want to map memory manually, cast integers to pointers, bit-fiddle your way into performance? C will not stop you. It respects you as a programmer even when you’re wrong.

Its standard library is surgical. You get exactly what you need to build real, complex programs nothing more. No runtime, no garbage collector, no unnecessary layers. If your program does not use something, it will not magically include it. That means tiny binaries, tight loops, and the comforting knowledge that what you wrote is what you get. C does not reinterpret your intent. It does not guess. It does what you told it to do, byte for byte, instruction for instruction. And that’s what makes it beautiful: it is honest, minimal, and precise.


Unlike many modern languages, C does not insert invisible steps between your code and the machine. What you write becomes what runs directly and predictably.

**C, my beloved.** No guardrails. No hand-holding. Just raw power, one pointer at a time.
